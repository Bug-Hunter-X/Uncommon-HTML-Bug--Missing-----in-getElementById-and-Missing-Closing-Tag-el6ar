This repository demonstrates a couple of uncommon HTML bugs that might not always throw errors but can lead to unexpected behavior. The first bug involves using `document.getElementById()` incorrectly without the '#' symbol before the id. The second bug is about missing a closing tag when creating dynamic HTML content, leading to unexpected issues with the layout and rendering of the page. The solution provides the corrected code snippets.
